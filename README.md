## Description 

Multi-platform application built for our semester long project in the ECSE 321 - Intro to Software Engineering course. The project purpose was to familiarize students with the Agile software development methodology and to apply our knowledge of the core material covered in this class. Along with the actual implementation of the code, we were also asked to complete a series of deliverables and milestones in which we had to complete tasks such as writing a requirements document, coming up with a design specification, creating a quality assurance plan, formulating a release pipeline plan and presenting the project to the whole class.
